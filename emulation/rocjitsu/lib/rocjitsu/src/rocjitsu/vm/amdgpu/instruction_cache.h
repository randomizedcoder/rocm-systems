/// @brief Per-compute-unit instruction cache (I$).
///
/// @details The issue path reads the 16 bytes at the PC for every instruction
/// it retires. Uncached, each of those reads walks the page table and takes a
/// reader lock on a GpuMemory page stripe. Every CU of a dispatch runs the same
/// kernel, so those reads all fall on the one stripe holding the code page and
/// contend on a single host cache line; that contention, not the emulation
/// work, dominates a multi-threaded run.
///
/// The cache is private to one CU and takes no lock. Lines are 64 bytes and
/// never straddle a page, so a fill costs one page-stripe lock instead of
/// sixteen word reads, and a kernel loop that fits in @ref kCacheBytes costs
/// none at all.
///
/// Coherence follows hardware: an AMDGPU I$ is not coherent with data writes,
/// and code that rewrites itself must issue s_icache_inv. The cache is
/// invalidated where the driver would issue one -- once per dispatch at kernel
/// launch, on s_icache_inv itself, at CU cache maintenance, and at the command
/// processor's device-wide maintenance around direct backing writes. It is
/// bypassed entirely while a debugger is attached, because breakpoint writes
/// reach code memory without any of those, and dropped on every attach and
/// detach so a session cannot leave a stale line behind either way.
