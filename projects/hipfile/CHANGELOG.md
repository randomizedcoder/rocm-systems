# Changelog for hipFile

## (Unreleased) hipFile 0.6.0

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

### Known issues

## hipFile 0.5.0 for ROCm 10.1.0

### Added

* Added a Stats API for querying hipFile I/O statistics. `hipFileGetStatsL1()`, `hipFileGetStatsL2()`, and `hipFileGetStatsL3()` return progressively more detailed counters: basic I/O and operation counts (Level 1), I/O size histograms (Level 2), and per-GPU statistics (Level 3).
* `ais-check` now detects SR-IOV virtual function (VF) GPUs via `amd-smi` and warns when one is present. hipFile's fastpath is only supported on GPU physical functions (PFs); on a VF, I/O falls back to the compatibility path. The check is skipped if `amd-smi` is unavailable.
* `hipFileReadAsync()` and `hipFileWriteAsync()` now support the AIS fastpath backend, enabling asynchronous GPU-direct I/O enqueued on a HIP stream. Transparent async backend failover to the slowpath is not currently supported for async fastpath operations.
* Batch operations now execute on an internal thread pool, enabling batch API support on the AMD backend. Together with async fastpath support, this resolves the 0.3.0 limitation where batch and async API calls were unsupported on the AMD backend.
* Added the `HIPFILE_ASYNC_BUFFER_SIZE` environment variable to control the size of the host bounce buffer used for asynchronous fallback I/O. The default size is 16 MiB; setting it to `0` uses the default.
* `ais-check` now reports whether an LVM logical volume supports fastpath.

### Changed

* The synchronous fallback I/O path now sets the active HIP device to the buffer's GPU before `hipMemcpy` and restores the caller's device afterward, fixing copies that could run against the wrong device context.
* Asynchronous fallback I/O now reuses a single per-stream bounce buffer, splitting large transfers into chunks that fit the buffer, to reduce the memory footprint of asynchronous workloads.

### Fixed

* Corrected CMake ROCm path detection so out-of-tree builds locate the correct ROCm installation.

### Removed

### Known issues

* Asynchronous operations that use the fastpath backend will not retry on the fallback backend. If asynchronous operations have proper alignment, they now run on the fastpath backend. If the fastpath device lookup fails or the P2P DMA transfer is not supported between the devices, the asynchronous operation will now fail.

## hipFile 0.4.0 for ROCm 10.0.0

### Added

* A KFD-based alternative check for P2P DMA support was added to `ais-check`. This inspects the `capability` property under `/sys/class/kfd/kfd/topology/nodes/*/properties`.
* Added support for Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volumes with a maximum of 16 extents
* Added guides for setting up storage targets to the documentation

### Changed

* `ais-check` now lists the AIS-capable file system mounts detected on the system and fails if none are found.
* Fastpath-only tests are now automatically skipped on systems that do not support the AIS fastpath instead of failing. Running ctest in verbose mode (`ctest -V`) will provide the reason why the test was skipped.
* Updated INSTALL.md to point to official install docs
* hipFileRead and hipFileWrite now return -1 with `errno` set to `EINVAL` for negative offsets instead of returning `-hipFileInternalError`

### Removed

### Known issues

## hipFile 0.3.0 for ROCm 7.14.0

### Added

* Examples can be installed on `share/doc/examples/*` by setting `AIS_INSTALL_EXAMPLES` to `ON`.
* An additional check has been added to the Fastpath/AIS backend to ensure the HIP Runtime is initialized, preventing segmentation faults when using the HIP Runtime.
* Added file type and file system validation in Fastpath. Fastpath will only accept I/O targeting block devices or regular files backed by xfs or ext4 with ordered journaling mode. Other file systems can be explicitly allowed via the `HIPFILE_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_SYSTEMS` environment variable.

### Changed

* `hipFileOpStatusError()` has been renamed to `hipFileGetOpErrorString()`.
* The `hipfile-doc` CMake target has been replaced with `doc`. The `AIS_BUILD_DOCS` CMake option must be enabled to build with this target.
* The CMake namespace has changed from `roc::` to `hip::`
* `AIS_BUILD_EXAMPLES` has been renamed to `AIS_INSTALL_EXAMPLES`
* `AIS_USE_SANITIZERS` now also enables the following sanitizers: integer, float-divide-by-zero, local-bounds, vptr, nullability (in addition to address, leak, and undefined). Sanitizers should also now emit usable stack trace info.
* The AIS optimized I/O path now automatically falls back to the POSIX I/O path if a failure occurs and the compatibility mode has not been disabled.
* The default CMake build type has changed from `Debug` to `RelWithDebInfo`

### Removed

* The rocFile library has been completely removed and the code is now a part of hipFile.
* The hipify patch was removed. hipify with hipFile support can be obtained from the main HIPIFY repo at https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY. The `amd-develop` branch has hipFile support, but this has not been officially released yet.
* The `AIS_USE_INTEGER_SANITIZER` CMake option has been removed. Use the `AIS_USE_SANITIZERS` option instead.
* Support for GNU sanitizers has been dropped in this release.

### Known issues

* Batch and async API calls are not supported on the AMD backend
* Poor performance with small I/O sizes (<= 64KiB) and many threads/processes
* Poor performance within QEMU virtual machine when PCIe devices are not attached to PCIe root ports
* High memory usage with many processes
* GPU resets encountered with many processes
